    "## Convolution Operation in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "The **convolution operation** is a fundamental building block of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It extracts local features from input data (such as images) by applying a **kernel/filter** that slides across the input, performing an element-wise multiplication and summation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Representation**  \n",
    "For a 2D image \\(I\\) and filter \\(K\\), the convolution is given by:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "S(i, j) = (I * K)(i, j) = \\sum_m \\sum_n I(m, n) \\cdot K(i - m, j - n)\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(I\\): Input image  \n",
    "- \\(K\\): Kernel/filter  \n",
    "- \\(S\\): Feature map (output of convolution)  \n",
    "- The filter moves across the image with a **stride**; optional **padding** ensures output size control.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "1. Place the filter over a region of the input.\n",
    "2. Perform element-wise multiplication between filter and input values.\n",
    "3. Sum the results to produce one output pixel.\n",
    "4. Slide the filter by stride and repeat.\n",
    "5. Produce a **feature map** highlighting patterns such as edges, textures, etc.\n",

    "### Advantages\n",
    "| Advantage | Description |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Parameter Sharing | Same filter weights are applied across the input, reducing parameters. |\n",
    "| Local Connectivity | Focuses on local patterns (edges, corners), enhancing feature extraction. |\n",
    "| Translation Invariance | Detects features regardless of their position in the input. |\n",
    "| Efficient Computation | Fewer parameters than fully connected layers. |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "| Disadvantage | Description |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Loss of Spatial Info | Pooling and strides may reduce precise spatial location of features. |\n",
    "| Computational Cost | For very large inputs and filters, computation can still be expensive. |\n",
    "| Requires Hyperparameter Tuning | Kernel size, stride, and padding must be carefully chosen. |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage / Applications\n",
    "| Application | Description |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Image Classification | Detects hierarchical features for object recognition. |\n",
    "| Object Detection | Identifies and localizes objects in images. |\n",
    "| Face Recognition | Extracts unique facial features for identification. |\n",
    "| Medical Imaging | Detects anomalies in X-rays, MRIs, CT scans. |\n",
