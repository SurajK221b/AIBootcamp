    "# ðŸ”¹ Dropout Layer in Neural Networks\n",

    "## 1. Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropout** is a regularization technique used to prevent **overfitting** in neural networks.  \n",
    "- During training, **random neurons are \"dropped\" (deactivated)** with a certain probability \\( p \\).  \n",
    "- This prevents neurons from becoming too dependent on specific features and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How Dropout Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "- At each training step, a neuron is:\n",
    "  - **Kept** with probability \\( (1 - p) \\)\n",
    "  - **Dropped** (set to 0) with probability \\( p \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the network learns **redundant representations**, making it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "For neuron output \\( y \\):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{y} = y \\cdot r\n",

    "- \\( r \\sim Bernoulli(1 - p) \\)  \n",
    "- \\( p \\) â†’ dropout rate (e.g., 0.2 or 20%)  \n",
    "- \\( y \\) â†’ neuron activation  \n",
    "- During **inference**, dropout is not applied; instead, activations are scaled by \\( (1 - p) \\).\n",

    "## 7. Interview Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1: Why is dropout not used during testing?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- During inference, all neurons are used, and outputs are scaled by \\( (1 - p) \\) to maintain expected activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: How does dropout prevent overfitting?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- By randomly deactivating neurons, the network cannot rely on specific activations and learns redundant, generalized representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: Is dropout applied to CNN convolution layers?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- Yes, but typically with lower dropout rates, because convolutional layers already have some built-in regularization via weight sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Conclusion\n",
    "- Dropout is a simple yet powerful regularization method.\n",
    "- It is especially effective in deep networks where overfitting is a concern.\n"
