    "# ðŸ§  Vanishing Gradient Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Definition\n",
    "The **Vanishing Gradient Problem** occurs in deep neural networks when the **gradients** used for weight updates become extremely small as they are propagated backward through many layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This leads to **very slow learning** or even **stalled training** for the earlier layers.\n",
    "- The issue is more severe when using activation functions like **Sigmoid** or **Tanh**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Does it Happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "During **backpropagation**, the gradient for a weight \\( w \\) in the first layer is calculated using the **chain rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w} =\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial y_L} \\cdot\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial y_L}{\\partial y_{L-1}} \\cdots\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial y_1}{\\partial w}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each derivative \\( \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} \\) is less than 1 for sigmoid/tanh.\n",
    "- Multiplying many small values results in a **very small gradient**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Mathematical Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sigmoid function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Its derivative is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)(1 - \\sigma(x)) \\leq 0.25\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even the largest gradient is only 0.25.\n",
    "- In an \\(n\\)-layer network, gradients scale like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(0.25)^n \\rightarrow 0 \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, gradients **vanish exponentially** in deep networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Consequences\n",
    "- Early layers stop updating (no learning).\n",
    "- Network fails to capture complex features.\n",
    "- Training is extremely slow or fails to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Relation with Sigmoid\n",
    "- Sigmoid saturates near 0 or 1 for large \\( |x| \\), making derivatives almost zero.\n",
    "- This is why deep networks using sigmoid activations often suffer from **vanishing gradients**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Technique**             | **How It Helps** |\n",
    "|---------------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **ReLU Activation**       | Gradient is 1 for \\( x > 0 \\), avoids vanishing. |\n",
    "| **Leaky ReLU / ELU**      | Allows small gradient for \\( x < 0 \\). |\n",
    "| **Batch Normalization**   | Keeps inputs within a range where gradients are stable. |\n",
    "| **Residual Connections (ResNet)** | Skip connections help gradients flow backward more effectively. |\n",
    "| **Weight Initialization** | Xavier/He initialization prevents extreme activation saturation. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Conclusion\n",
    "The **Vanishing Gradient Problem** is a major challenge in training deep networks with sigmoid or tanh activations.  \n",
    "Modern architectures (ReLU, ResNet) and techniques (Batch Normalization) mitigate this issue.\n",
