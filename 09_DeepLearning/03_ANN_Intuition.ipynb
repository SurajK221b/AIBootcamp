    "An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain’s neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of interconnected units called neurons, organized into layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron processes input data, applies weights, adds bias, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output."
