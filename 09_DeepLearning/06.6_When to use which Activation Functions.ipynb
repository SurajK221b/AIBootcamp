    "### **Q1: Why is ReLU the default choice for hidden layers?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- It is computationally efficient and avoids vanishing gradients for positive inputs, enabling deeper networks to train effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: Why is Softmax not used in hidden layers?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- Softmax forces outputs to sum to 1, restricting the representation.  \n",
    "- It is only meaningful in the final layer where class probabilities are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: When would you use ELU instead of ReLU?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- When you need zero-centered activations and smoother gradients to accelerate convergence.  \n",
    "- ELU is preferred in very deep architectures where ReLU's dying neuron problem is significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4: Can we use Sigmoid in hidden layers?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- It is **not recommended** because sigmoid suffers from the **vanishing gradient problem**, slowing learning in deep networks.\n",

    "## âœ… Conclusion\n",
    "Choosing the right activation function is critical:\n",
    "- **ReLU (and variants)** â†’ Best for hidden layers in deep networks.\n",
    "- **Sigmoid / Softmax** â†’ Best for output layers in classification tasks.\n",
