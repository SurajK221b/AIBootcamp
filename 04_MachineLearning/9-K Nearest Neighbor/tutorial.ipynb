    "| **Definition**         | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **non-parametric**, **lazy learning** algorithm used for **classification** and **regression** tasks.                    |\n",
    "| **Core Idea**          | It classifies or predicts a data point based on the majority class (or average in regression) among its **'K' nearest neighbors** in the feature space. |\n",
    "| **Lazy Learning**      | KNN does **not learn any model** during the training phase. It simply **stores the training data**, and all computations are deferred until prediction. |\n",
    "| **Distance Metric**    | Most commonly **Euclidean Distance** is used, but others like **Manhattan**, **Minkowski**, or **Hamming** (for categorical data) are also applicable.  |\n",
    "| **Hyperparameter (K)** | The number of neighbors (**K**) is a key parameter; optimal value is typically chosen using **cross-validation**.                                       |\n",
