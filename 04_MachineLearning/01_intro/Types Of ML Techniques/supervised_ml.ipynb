    "**Q1. What is Supervised Learning?**  \n",
    "Supervised learning is a subset of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means each training sample has an associated target or output label. The objective is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs that can generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the main categories under Supervised Learning?**  \n",
    "Supervised Learning is primarily divided into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression – predicting continuous numeric values (e.g., house price prediction).\n",
    "- Classification – predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., spam detection, fraud classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Name some widely used supervised learning algorithms.**  \n",
    "Key supervised learning techniques include:\n",

    "- Neural Networks (when used with labeled data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is the difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression?**  \n",
    "Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous outcomes and assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.  \n",
    "Logistic Regression, on the other hand, is used for binary or multi-class classification problems and outputs probabilities using a sigmoid or softmax function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What are the assumptions of Linear Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: Relationship between input and output must be linear.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: Constant variance of errors.\n",
    "- Independence: Observations should be independent.\n",
    "- Normality: Residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "- No multicollinearity: Features should not be highly correlated.\n",

    "- Biased towards features with more levels\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. How does Random Forest overcome the limitations of a Decision Tree?**  \n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees on bootstrapped subsets of data and averages their predictions (for regression) or uses majority voting (for classification). This reduces variance and overfitting while improving model robustness and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Explain the working of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).**  \n",
    "KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based algorithm that assigns a label based on the majority class among the 'K' closest data points in the feature space. The closeness is typically measured using Euclidean or Manhattan distance. KNN works well for small datasets but can be computationally expensive on large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. When would you prefer using Support Vector Machines (SVM)?**  \n",
    "SVMs are preferred when the data is high-dimensional and requires a clear margin of separation. They work well in binary classification problems and are robust to overfitting, especially when using a proper kernel function (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF). However, they are less effective for very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. What is Naive Bayes and when is it useful?**  \n",
    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption that features are independent given the class label. It is highly efficient and effective for text classification problems like spam detection and sentiment analysis. Despite its naive assumptions, it performs surprisingly well in many real-world applications.\n",
