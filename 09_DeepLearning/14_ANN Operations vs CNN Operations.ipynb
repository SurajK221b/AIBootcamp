    "## ANN Operations vs CNN Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "Both **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are neural architectures but they differ fundamentally in how they process data and learn patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANNs**: Consist of fully connected layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. Suitable for tabular or structured data.\n",
    "- **CNNs**: Use convolution and pooling layers to extract hierarchical spatial features from data (primarily images).\n",

    "| **Overfitting** | More prone to overfitting due to many parameters | Less prone (filters shared across input) |\n",
