    "\n",
    "## 1. Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)** is an activation function that improves upon ReLU by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeping the positive side identical to ReLU.\n",
    "- Allowing **negative outputs with smooth gradients**, reducing the dying ReLU problem.\n",
    "- Pushing mean activations closer to zero, helping with faster learning.\n",

    "x & \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Q1: How does ELU differ from ReLU and Leaky ReLU?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- ELU allows **negative outputs** like Leaky ReLU but also **smoothly** approaches a saturation value.  \n",
    "- Unlike ReLU, ELU outputs are **zero-centered**, helping with faster optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2: Why does ELU help with faster learning?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- The negative saturation pushes mean activations towards zero, improving weight updates and convergence speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3: When should you choose ELU over ReLU?**\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- Use ELU when you want the benefits of ReLU but also need smoother negative activations to avoid dying neurons and achieve faster convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Conclusion\n",
    "ELU combines the strengths of **ReLU** (efficient for positive values) and **Leaky ReLU** (non-zero negative gradients) while adding the benefit of **zero-centered outputs**.  \n",
    "It is effective in deep networks but slightly more computationally expensive due to exponential calculations.\n",
