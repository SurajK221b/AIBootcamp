    "### Task 1: Implementing Data Validation for Restaurant Reservations Using Pydantic\n",
    "\n",
    "At AlitQ Technologies, we're developing a booking system for a restaurant chain. This system must handle reservations while ensuring that all customer and reservation data is validated to prevent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we're using Pydantic to validate and manage the data. Pydantic ensures data integrity, making sure the information is correct and reliable before processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "AlitQ's system must handle the following reservation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer name\n",
    "- Reservation date\n",
    "- Number of guests\n",
    "- Optional special requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to write a program that defines a Pydantic model (class Reservation) to manage these reservation details. The model should validate:\n",
    "\n",
    "`customer_name` as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "`reservation_date` as a valid date\n",
    "\n",
    "`number_of_guests` as an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "`special_requests` as an optional string (can be empty)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures smooth operations and prevents invalid data from entering the system."
