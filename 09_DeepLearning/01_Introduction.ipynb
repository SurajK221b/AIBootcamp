    "## 1. Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw data. Unlike traditional ML, deep learning models can extract complex patterns and achieve state-of-the-art performance in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "Learns directly from raw data (images, text, audio) without manual feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizes large datasets and high computational power (e.g., GPUs, TPUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports end-to-end learning, enabling automatic feature extraction and classification."
